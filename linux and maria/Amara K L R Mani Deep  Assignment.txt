ABC inc collects customers data in a customer table  which is very sensitive data for company. Company want to implement audit in a way that if any one delete or modifies any existing record the details of user who changed, date and time of change and customerID of changed record should be written in a table called Cust_Audit.

How can we achieve this at database level?

Write nessasary code to get this done.




solution:
===========


let us assume the customer table consists of following attributes
custid,cname,age,city,pincode


inorder to monitor this table like which person delete /update data in this table is stored in table called cust_audit
these are fields we need to insert if any modifications done
customer details along with action (delete or update) and datetime and actionby(personname)


to implement this triggers are used 



Trigger for delete 
create or replace TRIGGER delete_cust_details 
before delete
on customer for each row

insert into cust_audit values (old.cid,old.cname,old.age,old.city,old.pincode,'delete',now(),current_user());



Trigger for update
create TRIGGER update_cust_details
before update
on customer for each row

insert into cust_audit values(old.cid,old.cname,old.age,old.city,old.pincode,'update',now(),current_user());


these are the triggers which we used to encounter the update or delete the customer dertails by whom at what and what action is perfoemd on data;
