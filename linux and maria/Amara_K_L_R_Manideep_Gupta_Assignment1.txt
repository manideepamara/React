1)what is shared mountpoint and unbindable mountpoint?

A)	1)shared mountpoint can be treated same of given specifed mount point.when the mount point is marked as shared it means

	any mount with in the original mount is copied or reflected in the shared and vice versa
	2)unbindable mount point is used to prevent the given mount point being duplicated,both mount points are different



2)create a directory under directory create three files which contain information about bank.write a command to find the count of 
all occurences of bank in all files under created directory	
	1.mkdir mani
 
	create a directory "mani"  
	2.touch mani/file1 mani/file2 mani/file3
 
	create a files under "mani" using touch 
	3.fill content using 
	cat >mani/file1 
	cat>mani/file2 
	cat>mani/file3
  
	4.grep -o -i "bank" mani/* |wc -l
	using grep to get the all occurencres and send it to wc command using pipe operator
	which actually finds the total occurences of bank 

3)write a command to continuously monitor the log file of service which is in running
	method 1 : the below command is used to get the last 10 lines of log file
	in order to repeat this continuously awk script is used to get the last 10 lines of log file
	tail -10 /var/log/<service-log-file>

	for continuous using awk script

	begin
	{
	
while(1)

	system("tail -10 /var/log/<service-log-file>")

	}

	{
}
	method 2:it is automatically listen to files and notify whenever file is updated
	tail -f /var/log/<service-log-file> 
	->f is used to follow the file if any thing added to files it display it
